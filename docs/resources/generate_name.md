# proactnaming_generate_name (Resource)

Generates standardized Azure resource names using the Azure Naming Tool following organizational naming conventions.

This resource creates names that comply with Azure naming rules and organizational standards. All input fields trigger resource replacement when changed, ensuring name consistency.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```terraform
resource "proactnaming_generate_name" "resource_group" {
  organization  = "myorg"
  resource_type = "rg"
  application   = "webapp"
  function      = "core"
  instance      = "001"
  location      = "euw"
  environment   = "dev"
}

# Use the generated name
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "main" {
  name     = proactnaming_generate_name.resource_group.resource_name
  location = "West Europe"
}
```

### Multiple Resources with Different Functions

```terraform
# Infrastructure resource group
resource "proactnaming_generate_name" "infra_rg" {
  organization  = "myorg"
  resource_type = "rg"
  application   = "webapp"
  function      = "infra"
  instance      = "001"
  location      = "euw"
  environment   = "prod"
}

# Application resource group
resource "proactnaming_generate_name" "app_rg" {
  organization  = "myorg"
  resource_type = "rg"
  application   = "webapp"
  function      = "app"
  instance      = "001"
  location      = "euw"
  environment   = "prod"
}

# Storage account for data
resource "proactnaming_generate_name" "storage" {
  organization  = "myorg"
  resource_type = "st"
  application   = "webapp"
  function      = "data"
  instance      = "001"
  location      = "euw"
  environment   = "prod"
}
```

### Multiple Instances

```terraform
# Generate names for multiple VM instances
resource "proactnaming_generate_name" "web_servers" {
  count = 3

  organization  = "myorg"
  resource_type = "vm"
  application   = "webapp"
  function      = "web"
  instance      = format("%03d", count.index + 1)
  location      = "euw"
  environment   = "prod"
}

# Use the names for actual VMs
resource "azurerm_linux_virtual_machine" "web" {
  count = 3
  
  name                = proactnaming_generate_name.web_servers[count.index].resource_name
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.main.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.main.location
  size                = "Standard_B2s"
  
  # ... other configuration
}
```

### With Variables

```terraform
variable "environment" {
  description = "Environment name"
  type        = string
  default     = "dev"
  
  validation {
    condition     = contains(["dev", "test", "stage", "prod"], var.environment)
    error_message = "Environment must be one of: dev, test, stage, prod."
  }
}

variable "application" {
  description = "Application name"
  type        = string
  default     = "webapp"
}

resource "proactnaming_generate_name" "example" {
  organization  = "myorg"
  resource_type = "rg"
  application   = var.application
  function      = "core"
  instance      = "001"
  location      = "euw"
  environment   = var.environment
}
```
