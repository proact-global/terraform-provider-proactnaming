# proactnaming Provider

The Proact Naming provider is used to interact with the Azure Naming Tool API to generate standardized Azure resource names following organizational naming conventions.

Use this provider to ensure consistent naming across your Azure infrastructure by leveraging centralized naming rules and conventions.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    proactnaming = {
      source  = "proact-global/proactnaming"
      version = "~> 1.0"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the provider using environment variables (recommended)
provider "proactnaming" {
  # Configuration via environment variables:
  # export PROACTNAMING_HOST="https://your-naming-tool.azurewebsites.net"
  # export PROACTNAMING_APIKEY="your-api-key"
  # export PROACTNAMING_ADMIN_PASSWORD="your-admin-password"  # Optional
}

# Generate a resource group name
resource "proactnaming_generate_name" "resource_group" {
  organization  = "myorg"
  resource_type = "rg"
  application   = "webapp"
  function      = "core"
  instance      = "001"
  location      = "euw"
  environment   = "dev"
}

# Use the generated name in Azure resources
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "main" {
  name     = proactnaming_generate_name.resource_group.resource_name
  location = "West Europe"
  
  tags = {
    Environment = "dev"
    Application = "webapp"
  }
}
```

### Alternative Configuration Methods

#### Direct Configuration (Not Recommended for Production)

```terraform
provider "proactnaming" {
  host           = "https://your-naming-tool.azurewebsites.net"
  apikey         = "your-api-key-here"
  admin_password = "your-admin-password" # Optional
}
```

#### Mixed Configuration

```terraform
provider "proactnaming" {
  host   = var.naming_tool_host
  apikey = var.naming_tool_apikey
  # admin_password from environment variable
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `admin_password` (String, Sensitive) Admin password for delete operations in the Azure Naming Tool. Can also be set via the `PROACTNAMING_ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable.

This password is only required for delete operations and should be kept secure.
- `apikey` (String, Sensitive) API key for authenticating with the Azure Naming Tool. Can also be set via the `PROACTNAMING_APIKEY` environment variable.

This key should have appropriate permissions to generate names via the API.
- `host` (String) The base URL for the Azure Naming Tool API. Can also be set via the `PROACTNAMING_HOST` environment variable.

Example: `https://your-naming-tool.azurewebsites.net`
